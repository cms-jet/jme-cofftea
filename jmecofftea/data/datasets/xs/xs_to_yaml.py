"""Script to convert the GenXSecAnalyzer list into YAML

The YAML format is a simple nested dictionary, where each top-level
key is the short name of a data set. For each data set, the cross
section as read from GenXSecAnalyzer will be available by the 'gen'
key. Additional keys can be added, e.g. for higher-order cross sections.
This script will *always* overwrite the 'gen' key, but *never* overwrite
other keys. Therefore, manually entered higher-order cross sections
are persistent.

Example:
    DY_2018:
        gen: 1 # from GenXSecAnalyzer
    DY_2017:
        gen: 0.9
